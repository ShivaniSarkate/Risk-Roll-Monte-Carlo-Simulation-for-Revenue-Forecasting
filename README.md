# 🎲 RiskRoll – Monte Carlo Simulation for Revenue Forecasting

## 🎯 Objective  
Simulate revenue outcomes under uncertainty using Monte Carlo methods to estimate risk and forecast performance.

## 🧪 Business Context  
Executives want to understand the likelihood of hitting revenue targets under uncertain conditions. Monte Carlo simulation helps quantify risk and guide contingency planning.

## 🧠 Workflow  
- Define revenue model with uncertainty  
- Simulate thousands of outcomes  
- Visualize distribution and confidence intervals  
- Estimate probability of hitting targets  
- Recommend risk mitigation strategies

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Target hit probability = 68.4%  
- Revenue range = ₹520K – ₹680K  
- Strategic actions based on risk profile
